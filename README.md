A Python-based network security automation tool that combines configuration automation and packet security inspection. It uses SSH to manage OSPF router configurations (e.g., DR change scheduling) and inspects PDUs in real time to detect untrusted traffic based on MAC addresses and OSPF domain validation. Suspicious packets are automatically quarantined or forwarded to an AI analysis system. Built with paramiko, socket, and schedule for secure and automated network defense.
